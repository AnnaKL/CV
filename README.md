## Anna Klimas

I'm an enthusiastic and self-driven recent Makers Academy graduate. A hard-working risk taker, who after successfull carrier as a Biomedical Scientist, decided to take a leap of faith and pursue an all time dream to learn to code. 
I'm currently looking for a passionate and creative team with a learning-friendly environment and exciting projects I could contribute to.
