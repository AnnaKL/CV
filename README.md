## Anna Klimas

An enthusiastic and self-driven Makers Academy graduate with curiosity about the world of technology. In my previous career as a Biomedical Scientist, I had the pleasure of working in a vibrant team of individuals and learnt the importance of communication, professionalism and dedication in improving patient health and wellbeing. I’m now applying these values to coding, my true passion.

Currently, I’m looking for a junior position in a creative and fun team where I can continue to learn and contribute to exciting projects.


## Skills

#### Full Stack Developer

I’ve learnt how to build full stack web applications across two languages : Ruby (Ruby on Rails) and Javascript(MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, NodeJS).
I love Ruby for it’s clear syntax and easy to read documentation, which makes it a perfect first language to learn. Rails for convention over configuration, which speeds up the development process, when followed.
I found Javascript very fun to use and appreciate the consistency it introduces in application architecture, as well as code logic, by allowing you to use the same language on both the client and server-sides.


#### Mobile Developer

I discovered and taught myself Ionic during the last two weeks at Makers Academy, when my team used it to delivered a mobile app as a final project. I love it for how it gives you the ability to build both IOS and Android mobile apps by using just Javascript, HTML and CSS. It allowed me to get a taste of mobile development by applying skills, which I already had.

#### Problem Solver

I enjoy the process of breaking a project into smaller pieces, anticipating potential issues and coming up with strategies to deal with them.

#### Team Player

I’m a committed and engaged team player. I’ve refined these skills with frequent pair programming and regular group project work.

#### Self-led Learner

My journey into the world of software development is one of ongoing learning. Following Makers Academy I have continued to explore full stack Javascript and Rails development, and have contributed to a mobile project in Ionic. I regularly attend meetups and events and am committed to becoming the best developer I can be.


## Projects

## Experience

#### Makers Academy (April 2015 to July 2015)

I learnt to write code in Ruby and Javascript languages whilst implementing key methodologies such as pair programming, SOLID, TDD/BDD, OOD, version control and Agile. I’ve built full stack applications and implemented a wide range of unit and feature testing suites to ensure my code is test-driven.
The course expose me to the best practices and taught me how to self-learn and look for answers. It also confirmed to me that I love programming and want to do it professionally.
