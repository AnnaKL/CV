## Anna Klimas

I'm an enthusiastic and self-driven recent Makers Academy graduate. A hard-working risk taker, who after successfull carrier as a Biomedical Scientist, decided to take a leap of faith and pursue an all time dream to learn to code. 
I'm currently looking for a passionate and creative team with a learning-friendly environment and exciting projects I could contribute to. 

## Skills

#### Programming

During the 12 weeks at Makers Academy I have been exposed to challenges teaching the best practices and pair-programming providing supportive learning environment and improving teamwork skills. I've learned to build front and backend web and mobile appliactions in Ruby and Javascript by using TDD approach and a version control system(Git).
